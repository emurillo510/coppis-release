	People may assume I am obsessed with fashion. On the contrary, I am obsessed with fixing a problem I always faced with not knowing about the new trends in streetwear fashion. I wanted a way for people, like me, to be up-to-date with the streetwear community. -Menandro Madlansacay, Cofounder of Coppis
