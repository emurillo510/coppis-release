<h3>Submitting a Post</h3>
<br>
<h4>Anyone can post!</h4>
Once signed in to Coppis, anyone can submit a post. In order to control quality, each post will be reviewed and if the post meets our requirements, it will be made available for other Coppis members to view.
<p>

<h4>Requirements?!</h4>
Yes. We want as many people in the streetwear community to be involved with sharing designs they have discovered, but we also want to ensure quality so that our users have a pleasant experience when visiting our site. So, login, click the “Submit” button, and send us the following:
<p>
   <li>Design Name</li>
   <li>Brand’s Name</li>
   <li>Picture or image of the design</li>
</p>
</p>
<h>Design Name</h> - We’d prefer the name of the design if it’s available, but we will accept a generic name  (ie: long sleeve white tee).
<br><h>Brand’s Name</h> - We require the name of the brand that made the design.
<br><h>Picture or Image</h> - It is important to us that a design and a brand is properly represented on our site, so we require high quality images. </p>

<p><h4>“SELFIE!”</h4> 
We will accept photographs one takes of themselves, but, Coppis is focused on streetwear designs. Here are some of the things we are looking for in an image:</p>


   <li>Design must be visible</li>
   <li>Image must be clear, so avoid blurry pictures due to shake or low light</li>
   <li>Good lighting is important because we want to see the design you are submitting</li>

<br>Once the submission has been reviewed and it meets our quality standards it will be posted in our Coppis feed where members can vote and comment on the design.
